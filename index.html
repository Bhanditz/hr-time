<section id="introduction" class='informative'>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The ECMAScript Language specification [[ECMA-262]] defines the Date object as a time value representing time in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. For most purposes, this definition of time is sufficient as
these values represent time to millisecond precision for any instant that is within approximately 285,616 years from
01 January, 1970 UTC. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#common-DOMTimeStamp">DOMTimeStamp</a> is defined similarly [[WebIDL]].
</p>

<p>
In practice, these definitions of time are subject to both clock skew and adjustment of the system clock. The value of time may not always be monotonically increasing and subsequent values may either decrease
or remain the same.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the following script may log a positive number, negative number, or zero.
  </p>
	<pre class='example highlight'>
var mark_start = Date.now();
doTask(); // Some task
if (window.console) window.console.log('Duration of task: ' + (Date.now() - mark_start));
	</pre>


<p>
For certain tasks this definition of time may not be sufficient as it does not allow for sub-millisecond resolution and is subject to system clock skew. For example,
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		When attempting to accurately measure the elapsed time of navigating to a Document, fetching of resources or execution of script, a monotonically increasing clock
		with sub-millisecond resolution is desired.
	</li>
	<li>
		When calculating the animation state from script, developers will need to accurately know the amount of time that has elapsed in the animation in order to properly update the
		next scene of the animation.
	</li>
	<li>
		When calculating the frame rate of a script based animation, developers will need sub-millisecond resolution in order to determine if an animation is drawing at 60 FPS.
		Without sub-millisecond resolution, a developer can only determine if an animation is drawing at 58.8 FPS or 62.5 FPS.
	</li>
	<li>
		In order to cue audio to a specific point in an animation or ensure that the audio is synchronized with the animation,
		developers will need to accurately know the amount of time elapsed in the animation and audio.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
This specification does not propose changing the behavior of <code>Date.now()</code> as it is genuinely useful in determining the current value of the calendar time and has a long history of
usage. The <a href="#domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> type and the <a href="#widl-Performance-now-DOMHighResTimeStamp"><code>now</code></a> method of the
<a href="#idl-def-Performance"><code>Performance</code></a> interface resolve the issues summarized in this section by providing a monotonically increasing time value in sub-millisecond resolution.
</p>

<section id='examples' class='informative'>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>A developer may wish to construct a timeline of their entire application, including events from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#worker">dedicated</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#sharedworker">shared workers</a>, which have a different <i><a href="#time-origin">time origin</a></i>. To display such events on the same timeline, the application can adjust the <a href="#domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamps</code></a> from the worker with the <a href="#dom-worker-start" title="workerStart">workerStart</a> attribute.</p>

<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;!-- Timing task in document --&gt;
var mark_start = performance.now();
doTaskInDocument(); // Some other task
var mark_end = performance.now();
var document_entry = {'task': 'Some document task',
                      'start_time': mark_start,
                      'end_time': mark_end};

&lt;!-- Timing task in dedicated or shared worker --&gt;
var worker = new SharedWorker('js');
worker.port.onmessage = function (event) {
  var worker_entry = event.data;

  // adjust timestamps to account for different time-origin
  worker_entry.start_time -= worker.workerStart;
  worker_entry.end_time -= worker.workerStart;
  plotTimeline([worker_entry, document_entry]);
}
</pre>

<p>Note that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#workerglobalscope">WorkerGlobalScope</a> doesn't have access to its workers' workerStart values. If needed, the document can send a message to the worker containing its <a href="#dom-worker-start" title="workerStart">workerStart</a> value.</p>

<section  id="conformance">

<p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes,
methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as requirements
on user agents. </p>

    <p>The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as
    required for conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL
    specification. [[!WebIDL]]</p>

<section id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where <code>Foo</code> is actually an interface, is sometimes used instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface <code>Foo</code>.</p>

<p>The term "JavaScript" is used to refer to ECMA262, rather than the
official term ECMAScript, since the term JavaScript is more widely known. [[ECMA-262]]</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
	This specification defines an interface that provides the current time
	in sub-millisecond resolution and such that it is not subject to system clock skew or adjustments.
</p>

</section>

<section id="h-time-origin">
<h3>Time Origin</h3>

<p>The <i id="time-origin">time origin</i> is the time value from which time is measured.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <i>time origin</i> must be equal to the time of the start of
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#navigate">navigation</a> of the current document. [[!html5]]</li>
  <li>The <i>time origin</i> for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#dedicated-workers-and-the-dedicatedworkerglobalscope-interface">dedicated</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#shared-workers-and-the-sharedworkerglobalscope-interface">shared</a> workers must be equal to the time of <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#official-moment-of-creation">creation</a> of the worker context. [[!workers]]</li>
</ul>

<p class='note'>
  The time value of the start of navigation of the document in an attribute of type <a href="#h-domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> is equal to 0.
  The same time value described with an attribute of type <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#common-DOMTimeStamp"><code>DOMTimeStamp</code></a>
  is equal to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/#dom-performancetiming-navigationstart"><code>navigationStart</code></a>
  attribute of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/#performancetiming"><code>PerformanceTiming</code></a> interface [[navigation-timing]].
</p>
</section>

<section id="DOMHighResTimeStamp">
<h3>The <code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code> Type</h3>
<p>
	The <a href="#h-domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> type is used to store a time value measured relative from the
	<i><a href="#time-origin">time origin</a></i> or a time value that represents a duration
	between two  <a href="#h-domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamps</code></a>.
</p>

<pre class='idl'>
typedef double DOMHighResTimeStamp;
</pre>

<p>A <a href="#h-domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> SHOULD represent a time in milliseconds accurate to a microsecond.</p>

<p class='note'>
If the User Agent is unable to provide a time value accurate to a microsecond due to hardware or software constraints, the User Agent
can represent a <a href="#h-domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond.

<dt>DOMHighResTimeStamp now()</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <dfn id="dom-performance-now"><code>now</code></dfn> method MUST
	return a <a href="#h-domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> representing the time in milliseconds
	from the <i><a href="#time-origin">time origin</a></i> to the occurrence of the call to the <a href="#widl-Performance-now-DOMHighResTimeStamp"><code>now</code></a> method.

<h3>The <code>workerStart</code> attribute</h3>

<dl title='partial interface AbstractWorker' class='idl'>

<dt>readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp workerStart</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>workerStart</code> attribute MUST return a <a href="#h-domhighrestimestamp"><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></a> representing the difference between the <i><a href="#time-origin">time origin</a></i> of <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#workerglobalscope">WorkerGlobalScope</a> [[!workers]] and the <i><a href="#time-origin">time origin</a></i> of the current document.</p>

<p class='note'>
  The value returned by <a href="#dom-worker-start" title="workerStart">workerStart</a> may be negative if a
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#sharedworkerglobalscope">SharedWorkerGlobalScope</a> already existed for the

<section id="monotonic-clock">
<h3>Monotonic Clock</h3>

<p>
The time values returned when calling the <a href="#widl-Performance-now-DOMHighResTimeStamp"><code>now</code></a> method MUST be monotonically increasing and not subject to system clock
adjustments or system clock skew. The difference between any two chronologically recorded time values returned from the
<a href="#widl-Performance-now-DOMHighResTimeStamp"><code>now</code></a> method MUST never be negative.
</p>
</section>

<section id="privacy-security">

<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
<p>
Statistical fingerprinting is a privacy concern where a malicious web site may determine whether a user has visited a
third-party web site by measuring the timing of cache hits and misses of resources in the third-party web site.
Though the <a href="#widl-Performance-now-DOMHighResTimeStamp"><code>now</code></a> method of the <a href="#idl-def-Performance"><code>Performance</code></a> interface
returns time data to a greater accuracy than before, it does not make this privacy concern significantly worse than it was already.
